In the online shopping world, if a group of friends wants to buy a gift together, what ends up happening is one person pays the total amount and then must collect the rest from their friends. This quickly becomes awkward as no one wants to be the annoying friend asking for money, and also no one wants to be the freeloader that doesn't pay their friends back. But with the current state of online shopping there is no solution that allows people to pay for an item as a group at the checkout. But with GroupCheckout, all you have to do is select pay as a group on the Shopify store of your choice and invite friends over social media to complete the purchase as a group. The application will generate a group shopping cart, where everyone can see who has already pitched in and how much is left to pay off the item. Once the amount is reached, the item is purchased and no one had to ask anyone for cash as the purchase was done collaboratively. To build this application, I would add it as an option in the shopping cart or check out page. The merchant can choose whether to allow the functionality in their site and then when the user chooses the option, they will be taken to a page where they can invite friends over Facebook, Email, Google account, etc. A page will be created that hosts the status of the group purchase and once everyone contributes their share the purchase is completed.
